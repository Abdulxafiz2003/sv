                    <p>I speak English, Russian, Arabic languages ​​and a little about web programming.Hobbies play a very important role in our lives. They occupy our minds when we are free and also make us happy. Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries. Moreover, they make our lives interesting and enjoyable. If we look at it, all our hobbies are very useful for us. They teach us a lot of things about different stuff. They also help in expanding our knowledge.</p>

                    <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                    <p>read books, watch YouTube, swim, eat, sleep, study, etc. As a matter of fact, my teamwork skills developed from my childhood. Nevertheless, its improved by doing group presentations, assignments with my groupmates. I believe that, having teams can result in faster and efficient outputs with better decision making skills. “Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success”(Ford, 1923). Comparatively, there are various advantages of teamwork for career development. For instance, It improves profitability as well as productivity as all the employees are highly motivated and skilled. A business or cooperation will not survive unless all members work as one team.</p>
